# SBA 316: The Document Object Model

# Introduction
This assessment measures your understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and your capability to implement its features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it!

# Objectives
Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience. Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application. Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

# Instructions
You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!
Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.
Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.
